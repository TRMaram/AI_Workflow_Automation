📊 AI-Powered Weekly Project Status Report – n8n Workflow (PMI_ex1)
🎯 Objective
Automate the generation and delivery of executive-grade weekly project reports using structured bug, support, and development data enriched with AI analysis and dynamic charting.

🛠️ Workflow Summary
This n8n workflow pulls structured bug data from Google Sheets, analyzes it using an LLM (e.g., GPT), embeds visual charts with QuickChart, converts the result to a PDF, and sends the final report to the project manager via email.

🔁 Automation Flow
1. 📅 Trigger – Schedule Trigger
Initiates the report generation weekly.

2. 📥 Data Source – Google Sheets
Fetches raw project data: bugs, support load, PM requests, and QA logs.

3. 🧮 Preprocessing – Code Node
Parses and formats the data for AI consumption ($input.all() to JSON).

4. 🤖 AI Report Generation – AI Agent1
Uses a structured prompt to:

Generate HTML sections for:
✅ Resolved Bugs
🚧 Development Progress
📌 PM Requests
🛠️ Support Load
📈 Weekly Metrics

Embed trends, blockers, KPIs, and team performance summaries.

Calls QuickChart dynamically for:

Bar chart (total vs resolved bugs)

Pie chart (status distribution)

Line chart (weekly resolution trend)

Doughnut chart (team comparison)

Horizontal bar chart (bug types)

5. 📊 QuickChart Integration – HTTP Request1
Sends chart data to QuickChart.io API and receives image URLs for embedding.

6. 🧼 HTML Cleanup – Code1 + HTML
Cleans AI-generated HTML and prepares it for PDF rendering.

7. 📄 PDF Export – HTTP Request
Sends HTML to ConvertAPI to generate a PDF report.

8. 📧 Distribution – Gmail
