📊 Intelligent Risk Prediction & Alert System
🧠 Objective
Leverage historical and real-time data to predict project delivery risks and automatically notify the project manager with actionable insights.

🔁 Workflow Overview
1. 📥 Data Integration
Trigger: Use n8n to integrate with your project management tools (e.g. Asana, Jira), timesheets (e.g. Clockify), or Git update logs.

Purpose: Continuously collect relevant project data to monitor team activity and project status in real-time.

2. 📈 Predictive Analytics
Action: Forward the collected data to a machine learning API or custom predictive model using a Zapier Webhook.

Process: The model compares live data with historical trends to detect:

Risk of delay

Support overload

QA bottlenecks

Developer velocity issues

3. 🚨 Threshold Check
Rule: Define a risk threshold (e.g. delay_risk > 30%) within the automation logic.

Purpose: Only trigger alerts when the situation requires attention.

4. 📬 Alert & Mitigation
Trigger: If risk exceeds the threshold:

Send an automated alert via email or Slack to the project manager.

Automatically create follow-up tasks in your PM tool (e.g. Asana, Trello, Jira) for risk mitigation.

✅ Example Use Case
A delay risk of 68% is detected by the AI model.
📌 Recommended Action: Assign critical tasks to the senior support engineer.
🛠 A follow-up task is created in Asana, and the PM receives a Slack alert.
