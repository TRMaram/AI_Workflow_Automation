Automated Document Organization &amp; Retrieval
Objective: Organize project documents automatically and enable smart retrieval using
natural language queries.
Steps:
1. Document Capture:
o Zapier Trigger: Monitor your document repositories (Google Drive,
OneDrive, or SharePoint) for new or updated files.

2. AI Document Analysis:
o Action: Send the document text or metadata to an AI service that
performs content analysis, tagging, and classification.
o Process: The AI identifies key topics, assigns tags, and generates
summaries for each document.

3. Metadata Update:
o Action: Automatically update a centralized database or document
management system with the AI-generated metadata using Zapier.

4. Smart Retrieval Interface:
o Action: Integrate a chatbot (or a search interface) that uses natural
language processing to allow team members to query for documents.
o Process: When a query is received, the system returns the most relevant
documents based on the AI-tagged metadata.
